Dreamhost stands out with its commitment to open-source technologies and transparent pricing, making it a solid choice for artists seeking a dependable and ethically driven hosting partner. Their plans offer a blend of affordability and comprehensive features, ideal for showcasing visual art.

### Uptime Guarantee:
Dreamhost offers a 100% uptime guarantee. This is a bold claim and demonstrates their confidence in their infrastructure. However, it's important to read the fine print to understand how uptime is measured and what compensation is offered in case of downtime. They often credit your account for the time your site is down.

### Storage:
Dreamhost's shared hosting plans offer unlimited storage, which is fantastic for hosting high-resolution images and videos of your glassblowing work. However, it’s important to note that unlimited storage often comes with acceptable use policies that limit the types of files you can store (e.g., no archiving). Their VPS and dedicated server options offer specific storage limits, but they are usually very generous and customizable.

### Bandwidth:
Similar to storage, Dreamhost offers unlimited bandwidth on their shared hosting plans. This means you won't have to worry about your site slowing down or incurring extra charges due to high traffic. Again, check the acceptable use policy to ensure your bandwidth usage complies with their terms.

### Website Builder:
Dreamhost provides its own website builder, which is simple and intuitive for creating basic websites. However, for a custom glassblowing website, you might prefer using a more robust content management system (CMS) like WordPress, which Dreamhost fully supports with one-click installation.

### Customer Support:
Dreamhost offers 24/7 customer support via live chat and email. Their live chat support can be a bit slow at times, but their email support is generally responsive and helpful. They also have an extensive knowledge base with articles and tutorials.

### Pricing:
Dreamhost's shared hosting plans start at around $2.95 per month for a single website. Their DreamPress (managed WordPress hosting) plans start at around $16.95 per month. Dreamhost also offers a generous 97-day money-back guarantee, which gives you ample time to test their services.
