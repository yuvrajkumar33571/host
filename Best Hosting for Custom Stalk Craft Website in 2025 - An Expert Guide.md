These technologies ensure your website loads quickly, even with a lot of images or custom content. Fast loading times improve user experience and can positively impact your website's search engine ranking.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting's managed VPS plans start at around $14.95 per month, offering a good balance of features and affordability.
